# Release Notes

BOPTEST-Gym has two main dependencies: BOPTEST and Stable-Baselines3. For simplicity, the first two digits of the version number match the same two digits of the BOPTEST version of which BOPTEST-Gym is compatible with. For example, BOPTEST-Gym v0.3.x is compatible with BOPTEST v0.3.x. The last digit is reserved for other internal edits specific to this repository only. See [here](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/master/releasenotes.md) for BOPTEST release notes.
